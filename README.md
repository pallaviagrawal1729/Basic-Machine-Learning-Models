# Basic-Machine-Learning-Models
while learning Machine Learning, I tried many different algorithms on very small datasets using Python and R
Natural Language Processing for Reviews                                                                                              
A very well-known model in NLP is the Bag of Words model. It is a model used to pre-process the texts to classify before fitting the classification algorithms on the observations containing the texts. Using our dataset of Restaurant reviews, we first Clean texts to prepare them for the Machine Learning models. Then we create Bags of words model and apply Machine Learning model onto this bags of words model. We make predictions and check the goodness via confusion matrix. 
 
A Movie Recommendation System
The aim of this project is to understand the working of Recommendations Systems because recommendation system helps users find compelling content in a large corpora. And hence, train a softmax model using the MovieLens data set. The system further helps in Visualizing the movie embeddings. 
 
Clustering with K-means Using Different Similarity Measure and comparing performance
The aim of this project is to apply K-means Clustering using different similarity measures and comparing the performance and understanding which one to use when. We create clusters using Manual and Supervised similarity measure. We generate quality metrics and interpret the results. The dataset used for this is Chocolate Bar Ratings. Most important result is that the DNN eliminates redundant information.

Use of Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Cat and Dog
The aim of this project is to use Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of photos of Dogs and Cats. The same model can be trained to classify other objects or animals also. 
 
Loan Payment Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier
The aim of this project is to help Banks determine how many of their customers will pay back the loan and for this we use Decision Tree Classifier as well as Logistic Regression.
 
 Classification of News on the website                                                                                             
 As we see in day to day life, a lot occurs every day and every minute. But that every thing (every news) is not useful for us and moreover it is a time wastage. Hence, it is very important to view the news that are useful to a particular user. For this, We have trained a simple model to perform text classification. This classifier classify news into different topics by going through the text of news headline only.
 
 Colour Compression of Images                  
 Most of the times we are required to compress the image before sending it to different sources using different medium. So, here we try to perform colour compression on images using K-means Clustering.
